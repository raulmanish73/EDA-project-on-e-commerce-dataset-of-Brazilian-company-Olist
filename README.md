# Olist-Ecommerce-Project

Business Understanding

This is a real-world dataset coming from the brazilian ecommerce company Olist.

Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

Attention

An order might have multiple items.
Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
